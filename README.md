# ePortal

ePortal is an iOS native application developed to livestream any type of auction.  Think a blend of Periscope and QVC.  Any user can create a broadcast and auction items to a group.  Users can watch any auction and bid on items that the broadcaster is presenting.

ePortal allows anyone to create their own mini QVC channel and livestream auctions for items.  Viewers can send live comments to broadcaster similar to Periscope or Instagram Live.

I developed this application for fun using Swift & OpenTok (Livestream).
